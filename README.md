The Witch and the Troll:
A text based game I wrote in Python.
The functions in the beginning represents different creatures you meet along the way, that adds or subtracts from your life score.
Unfortunately the fun parts are in Swedish... But the code is in Python :) So I decided to upload it.




Christmas Quiz:
This is a very basic quiz I made just for fun, and to show my family what I'm doing. 
The user get to answer some questions, points gets stored in a variable, and then the user get a 
grade in the end.
